## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Alerts?
1. Check thresholds in config
2. Verify data is updating
3. Manually trigger: `POST /api/alerts/trigger`
4. Check `data/alerts.json` exists

### Too Many Alerts?
1. Increase thresholds (e.g., 10% instead of 5%)
2. Increase cooldown periods
3. Filter by severity in dashboard

### Duplicate Alerts?
- System already prevents duplicates
- Check cooldown periods in code
- Verify `_has_recent_alert()` is working
