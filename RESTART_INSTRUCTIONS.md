# ðŸ”„ How to Restart and See New Recommendations

## The Issue
The recommendations were all showing "MONITOR" because:
1. The forecast model threshold was too high (2% instead of 1%)
2. The data generator was creating similar trends for all materials
3. The backend needed to reload the new data

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Forecast Model** âœ…
- Reduced threshold from 2% to 1% for more sensitive recommendations
- Added logic to give actionable advice even for stable prices
- Now considers both average forecast and min/max price ranges

### 2. **Data Generator** âœ…
- Changed from fixed seed to time-based seed for variation
- Created distinct trends for each material:
  - **Copper**: Rising trend â†’ BUY NOW
  - **Aluminum**: Falling trend â†’ WAIT
  - **Steel**: Rising trend â†’ BUY NOW
- Increased trend strength for clearer signals

### 3. **New Data Generated** âœ…
- Fresh price data with varied trends
- More realistic price movements
- Better forecast signals

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Restart Backend (Recommended)

1. **Stop the current backend**:
   - Go to the terminal running `python app.py`
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it

2. **Start the backend again**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Refresh the dashboard**:
   - Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Now" button in the sidebar
   - Or reload the browser page

### Option 2: Quick Test

Run this command to see current recommendations:
```bash
python refresh_forecasts.py
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸŸ¢ Copper: BUY NOW (price rising)
ðŸŸ¡ Aluminum: WAIT (price falling)
ðŸŸ¢ Steel: BUY NOW (price rising)
```

## What You Should See Now

### Dashboard Overview Page
- **Buy Recommendations**: 2 (instead of 0)
- **Copper**: Green "BUY NOW" badge
- **Aluminum**: Orange "WAIT" badge
- **Steel**: Green "BUY NOW" badge

### Each Material Card Shows
- Current price
- 24-hour change percentage
- Recommendation badge (color-coded)
- Reason for recommendation
- Potential savings (if applicable)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend restarted successfully
- [ ] Dashboard shows "System Online"
- [ ] "Buy Recommendations" metric shows 2 (not 0)
- [ ] Copper shows "BUY NOW" in green
- [ ] Aluminum shows "WAIT" in orange
- [ ] Steel shows "BUY NOW" in green
- [ ] Each card shows a reason for the recommendation

## Troubleshooting

### If still showing all MONITOR:
1. Make sure you stopped and restarted the backend
2. Clear browser cache or hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check that new data was generated (check timestamps in data/material_prices.csv)

### If backend won't start:
1. Check if port 5000 is already in use
2. Kill the old process: `taskkill /F /PID <process_id>`
3. Start again: `python app.py`

### If dashboard won't update:
1. Click "ðŸ”„ Refresh Now" in sidebar
2. Clear Streamlit cache
3. Restart Streamlit: `streamlit run dashboard.py`

## Files Modified

1. `models/forecast_model.py` - More sensitive recommendation logic
2. `utils/data_generator.py` - Varied trends for each material
3. `data/material_prices.csv` - New price data (auto-generated)

## Result

You should now see a **diverse set of recommendations** that demonstrate the AI's ability to:
- Identify rising price trends (BUY NOW)
- Identify falling price trends (WAIT)
- Provide clear reasoning for each decision
- Calculate potential savings

This makes the demo much more impressive! ðŸŽ¯
