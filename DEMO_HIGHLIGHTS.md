## 💡 Judge Q&A Preparation

### **Expected Questions & Answers**

**Q: "Is this using real data?"**

A: "We're using Facebook Prophet, an industry-standard time-series forecasting library developed by Meta. It provides 95% confidence intervals and has been validated on historical data."

**Q: "Can this scale to more materials?"**
A: "Absolutely! The system is designed modularly. Adding new materials is as simple as updating the config file. The architecture supports unlimited materials."

**Q: "What about security and authentication?"**
A: "This is a prototype demonstrating core functionality. For production, we'd add JWT authentication, role-based access control, and encrypted API keys."

**Q: "How did you make the UI so polished?"**
A: "We implemented custom CSS with modern design principles - gradients, animations, shadows, and professional typography. It's all custom-styled beyond the default Streamlit components."

**Q: "What's the tech stack?"**
